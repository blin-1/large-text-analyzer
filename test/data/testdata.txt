Frank Herbert’s classic science fiction novel will live for generations as a masterpiece of creative imagination.

In this game you can bring to life the forbidding alien planet and the swirling intrigues of all the book’s major characters.

Dune - the very name conjures up desolation. Desert sandscapes cover most of the planet surface, broken only by giant rock ridges. Giant worms a quarter mile long live beneath the sand and attack any who linger on it. Human life exists in a few scattered places where precious water is available, but even those settlements are buffeted by terrifying coriolis storms.

Yet the planet is crucial to the destiny of a galactic empire. Because only on Dune! spice can be harvested.

Spice is the key to interstellar travel. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace. Spice is also a geriatric medicine which prolongs life. Only by assuring a stable supply of it throughout the galaxy can any Emperor avoid civil revolt. With spice, in short, one can buy whatever he wants.

Powerful forces struggle for control of Dune. Imperial troops, aristocratic families, Guildsmen, a secret sisterhood, and the nomadic native Fremen all vie for power on the planet.
